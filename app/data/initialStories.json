        "teaserContent": "If batteries did not weigh or cost so much, most drivers might be wheeling electric vehicles by now.  A new Utah State University technology could overcome this barrier to electrically powered transport. How? By transferring power through the air, from charging pads embedded in a road to a vehicle's undercarriage 10 inches above, minimizing the need for on-board power storage.  This fall a USU start-up company will test the economic viability of such as wireless power transfer, or WPT, in the shuttle bus system at the University of Utah. Fueled with a federal grant, the U. is installing charging pads at bus stops and buying new electric buses to supplement its 28-bus fleet of diesel and compressed natural gas-powered vehicles.",

The bus will be retrofitted with a WAVE wireless charging pad under the bus, developed by the Utah State University Energy Dynamics Laboratory, a provider of wireless power transfer for vehicles. This technology will allow the BYD electric buses to pull up over an embedded charger in the asphalt with a maximum of 10 inches clearance and “opportunity charge” the waiting bus with no moving parts or unsightly wires required. The embedded charge pads measure about three feet square and pose no danger to the public, according to BYD.",
